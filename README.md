Other key team members include the **AI Lead**, **Hardware Engineer**, **Testing Team**, and **Administrative Support Staff**. Collaboration tools like Slack and Jira will facilitate communication and project tracking.

**Principles followed:**
- **Iterative Development**: Breaking the project into manageable phases.
- **Collaboration**: Regular communication between cross-functional teams.
- **Feedback Loops**: Continuous feedback and adjustments based on performance and stakeholder input.
